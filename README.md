# MockMate AI

> Practice interviews with an AI interviewer (or take an AI quiz) and get instant, actionable feedback.

A single project that runs a **React (Vite + JavaScript) client** and an
**Express (JavaScript + Google Gemini) server** together, from **one command**,
using **one shared `.env`**.

Everything is written in plain **JavaScript / JSX** — no TypeScript. The backend
is small CommonJS files (one model per file, one controller per feature); the
frontend is small React components and pages, one clear job each.

---

## Features

- **Email + password auth** (JWT in an httpOnly cookie *and* a `Bearer` header).
  A password reset revokes any tokens issued before it (via `tokenVersion`).
- **Email OTP verification** — optional at signup (create the account now, verify
  later) with resend. When an admin makes verification mandatory, a new account is
  created but no session is issued until the email is verified.
- **Forgot / reset password** using the same OTP system.
- **Admin panel** — manage users (verify/unverify, promote/demote admin, delete),
  a flexible add/edit/rename/delete settings table, and a global toggle that makes
  email verification mandatory.
- **Multiple Gemini API keys with auto-fallback** — tries keys in order and skips
  a rate-limited key for a short cooldown.
- **Two practice modes** — open-ended **Questions** (AI-graded) or a multiple-choice
  **Quiz** (auto-scored, includes "what's the output of this code?" problem-solving
  questions).
- **Role + experience aware** — questions match the role and experience level you pick.
- **Resume-tailored questions** — upload a PDF; its text is used to tailor questions.
- **Session history** — every interview/quiz is saved; reopen a past one or delete it.

> The app still works **without** a Gemini key: *Questions* mode falls back to a
> seeded question bank and heuristic scoring. *Quiz* mode needs a working key
> (it's fully AI-generated).

## Prerequisites

| Tool               | Version    | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Node.js**        | ≥ 18       | Required by Vite 6, and for the global `fetch`. `node -v`.   |
| **npm**            | ≥ 9        | Ships with Node 18+.                                          |
| **MongoDB**        | any recent | Local (`mongod`) or a MongoDB Atlas URI.                     |
| **Gemini API key** | optional   | Free key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). Without it, Questions mode uses the offline fallback; Quiz mode is disabled. |

## Quick start

```bash
cd Ai-Mock-Interview

npm run setup          # 1) install root + client + server deps
cp .env.example .env   # 2) create your env (fill in the secrets)
npm run seed           # 3) create the admin user + default settings + fallback bank
npm run dev            # 4) run client + server together
```

- Client → http://localhost:5174
- Server → http://localhost:5050  (health check: `GET /api/health`)

> **Ports:** this project uses **5050** (server) and **5174** (client) so it
> doesn't clash with a sibling "mockmate" project on 5000/5173. Change `PORT`
> (`.env`) and Vite's `server.port` / `proxy` in
> [`client/vite.config.js`](client/vite.config.js) if you like — keep them in sync.

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` to the backend, so the client calls `/api/...`
directly with no CORS setup in development.

---

## Default admin & OTP codes (local dev)

`npm run seed` creates/updates an **admin** user from the `ADMIN_*` values in
`.env` (default `admin@mockmate.com` / `Admin@123`). Sign in and open **Admin**
in the navbar.

OTP codes are delivered only through configured SMTP email. They are never
printed to the server console or returned by the API. Configure `SMTP_*` before
using email verification or password reset.

---

## One shared environment

There is a **single `.env`** at the project root — both apps read it:

- The **server** loads it via [`server/src/config/env.js`](server/src/config/env.js)
  (`dotenv`, pointed at the repo root).
- The **client** loads it via Vite's `envDir: '..'` in
  [`client/vite.config.js`](client/vite.config.js).

Only variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to the browser bundle, so server
secrets stay server-side even though they live in the same file.

| Variable          | Used by | Purpose                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`            | server  | API port (default 5050)                                                 |
| `NODE_ENV`        | server  | `development` / `production` (controls secure cookies)                  |
| `CLIENT_URL`      | server  | CORS origin for the frontend. **Blank = same-origin** (prod)            |
| `MONGODB_URI`     | server  | MongoDB connection string (**note the name — not `MONGO_URI`**)         |
| `JWT_SECRET`      | server  | Signing secret for auth tokens                                          |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`  | server  | Token lifetime (e.g. `7d`)                                              |
| `ADMIN_NAME/EMAIL/PASSWORD` | seed | The admin account created by `npm run seed`                       |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`  | server  | A single Gemini key (optional)                                          |
| `GEMINI_API_KEYS` | server  | Multiple keys, comma-separated, for auto-fallback (optional)           |
| `GEMINI_MODEL`    | server  | Gemini model (default `gemini-2.5-flash`)                               |
| `SMTP_HOST/PORT/USER/PASS/FROM` | server | Required SMTP configuration for OTP emails                     |
| `VITE_API_URL`    | client  | Base URL of the API (browser-exposed). Blank = relative `/api`          |

> You can also add/rotate **Gemini keys** from the **admin panel** (stored in the
> DB), on top of any keys in `.env`.

## How the AI works

All AI lives in [`server/src/services/gemini.js`](server/src/services/gemini.js):

| Function              | With a working key                                     | Without a key                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `generateQuestions()` | Gemini writes role/experience-specific questions       | seeded question bank (offline)         |
| `generateQuiz()`      | Gemini writes MCQs incl. code-output questions          | **disabled** (API returns 503)         |
| `evaluateInterview()` | Gemini grades each answer + overall score              | length-based heuristic scoring         |

**Multiple keys / auto-fallback:** keys are gathered from the admin setting
`gemini_api_keys` (array) plus `GEMINI_API_KEYS` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`.
`generateJson()` tries them in order; a key that hits an error is put on a short
in-memory cooldown and skipped until it expires, then retried. Simple loop +
timestamp — no queue or worker.

---

## Auth & sessions

- A JWT is signed with the user id **and** their current `tokenVersion`, and sent
  as an httpOnly cookie plus returned for the `Bearer` header.
- `requireAuth` verifies the token, then loads the user and checks the account
  still exists and the token's `tokenVersion` still matches — so a **password
  reset (which bumps `tokenVersion`) instantly invalidates older tokens** on every
  device.
- **Ownership is enforced server-side:** interview reads/writes/deletes are scoped
  to the signed-in user (`{ user: req.userId }`), so no one can touch another
  user's data. Admin routes additionally require the `admin` role.
- Admins can't delete or change the role of **their own** account (prevents an
  accidental self-lockout).

---

## Deployment (localhost vs Vercel)

The app runs as **two pieces**: a static client and an API server. Common
"works locally, breaks after deploy" causes are handled:

1. **Env var name** — the code reads `MONGODB_URI`. (The old `.env` used
   `MONGO_URI`, which was never read, so it silently used localhost. Fixed.)
2. **API base URL** — the client uses `VITE_API_URL`, falling back to a relative
   `/api`. In production set `VITE_API_URL` to your deployed API origin
   (e.g. `https://your-api.onrender.com/api`).
3. **SPA routing (404 on refresh)** — [`client/vercel.json`](client/vercel.json)
   rewrites all non-`/api` paths to `index.html` so `/dashboard`, `/admin`, etc.
   don't 404 on reload.
4. **Cross-site cookies** — in production the auth cookie is sent with
   `SameSite=None; Secure` so it survives a client and API on different domains.
   Set `CLIENT_URL` to the exact frontend origin (for CORS with credentials).
5. **No local disk needed** — uploaded resumes are parsed **in memory** and only
   the extracted text is stored, so it works on serverless hosts.

**Recommended shape:** deploy the **client** to Vercel (root = `client/`,
build `npm run build`, output `dist`) and the **server** to a host that runs a
long-lived Node process (Render / Railway / Fly). Point `VITE_API_URL` at the
server and set `CLIENT_URL` on the server to the Vercel URL.

### Fix for Vercel + Render login CORS errors

If the browser console shows a request to `http://localhost:5050` from the
Vercel site, the deployed client was built with the local API URL. Update both
hosts, then redeploy them:

| Host | Dashboard location | Name | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vercel (Production) | Project -> Settings -> Environment Variables | `VITE_API_URL` | `https://YOUR-RENDER-SERVICE.onrender.com/api` |
| Render | Service -> Environment | `CLIENT_URL` | `https://ai-mock-interview-83spf9fuj-mohd-zaid-s-projects1.vercel.app` |
| Render | Service -> Environment | `NODE_ENV` | `production` |

Do not include a trailing slash in either URL. **Redeploy Render after changing
`CLIENT_URL`, then redeploy Vercel after changing `VITE_API_URL`**. `VITE_*`
values are compiled into the client bundle, so updating a Vercel environment
variable alone cannot change an already-deployed site. Verify the server first
at `https://YOUR-RENDER-SERVICE.onrender.com/api/health`; it should return JSON
with `"status": "ok"`.

## Project Structure

Every file, with a one-line explanation.

### Root

| File / folder            | What it does                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `package.json`           | Orchestrator scripts — `setup` / `dev` / `build` / `start` / `seed`.        |
| `.env` / `.env.example`  | The single shared environment for both apps.                                |
| `.gitignore`             | Ignores `node_modules`, `dist`, and the `.env`.                             |

### Server — `server/src/`

| File                              | What it does                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.js`                        | Entry point. Loads env, connects to MongoDB, then starts Express. Exits if the DB is unreachable. |
| `app.js`                          | Builds the Express app: CORS, JSON + cookie parsing, logging, mounts the routers, `/api/health`, 404 + error handlers. |
| `seed.js`                         | `npm run seed` — inserts the fallback question bank, upserts the admin user, and default settings. |
| **config/**                       |                                                                                                |
| `config/env.js`                   | Loads the shared root `.env` (required first, before anything reads `process.env`).            |
| `config/db.js`                    | `connectDB(uri)` — thin wrapper around `mongoose.connect`.                                      |

| `models/User.model.js`            | User schema — name/email/passwordHash, `role`, `isVerified` + `otp*` fields, `resumeText`, and `tokenVersion` (bumped on reset to revoke old JWTs). |
| `models/Interview.model.js`       | Interview schema — role/experience/difficulty/`mode`, embedded questions (open-ended **and** quiz fields), overall score/summary. |
| `models/Question.model.js`        | Seed-time fallback question bank (used only in Questions mode when Gemini is unavailable).      |
| `models/Setting.model.js`         | Flexible `{ key, value }` config the admin panel edits (value is Mixed — string/boolean/array). |
| **controllers/** (one per feature)|                                                                                                |
| `controllers/auth.controller.js`  | register / login / verify-otp / resend-otp / forgot-password / reset-password / logout / me. Reset bumps `tokenVersion`; register withholds the session when verification is mandatory. |
| `controllers/admin.controller.js` | users (list, set verified, change role, delete — with self-guards) + settings CRUD (list/upsert/rename/delete). |
| `controllers/interview.controller.js` | start (questions or quiz), list, get one, submit (AI grade or quiz auto-score), delete, resume upload (PDF → text via `unpdf`). |
| **routes/** (thin)                |                                                                                                |

| `middleware/auth.js`              | `requireAuth` (verifies the Bearer/cookie JWT, then confirms the user exists and the token's `tokenVersion` matches) and `requireAdmin` (checks the admin role). |
| `middleware/validate.js`          | `validate(schema)` — Zod body validation, 400 on failure.                                       |
| `middleware/error.js`             | 404 handler + central error handler (maps common Mongo/Multer errors).                          |

| **components/**                   |                                                                                                |
| `components/Navbar.jsx`           | Top navigation — auth-aware links, admin link, sign-out.                                        |
| `components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`   | Guard — waits for auth, redirects to `/login` if signed out.                                    |
| `components/AdminRoute.jsx`       | Guard — like ProtectedRoute but also requires the admin role.                                   |

| `pages/Login.jsx`                 | Sign in; routes to `/verify` when the API says verification is required.                        |
| `pages/Register.jsx`              | Sign up, then send the user to `/verify`.                                                       |
| `pages/OtpVerify.jsx`             | Enter the email OTP, resend it, or **skip** for now.                                            |

| `pages/AdminDashboard.jsx`        | Admin panel — verification toggle, Gemini keys, users table (verify, promote/demote, delete), flexible settings CRUD. |
| **config**                        |                                                                                                |
| `index.html`                      | Vite HTML entry (loads `/src/main.jsx`).                                                        |
| `vite.config.js`                  | Vite config — port 5174, `/api` proxy → 5050, `envDir: '..'` for the shared `.env`.            |
| `jsconfig.json`                   | Light JS/JSX editor config (no type-checking).                                                  |
| `vercel.json`                     | SPA rewrite so client-side routes don't 404 on refresh when deployed.                           |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                     | Fix                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EADDRINUSE` / port already in use          | Change `PORT` (server) or Vite `server.port`, or stop whatever is on 5050 / 5174.   |
| `Could not connect to MongoDB`              | MongoDB isn't running or `MONGODB_URI` is wrong. Start `mongod` or fix the URI.     |
| `querySrv ECONNREFUSED` with an Atlas URI   | Your network can't resolve the `mongodb+srv` SRV record. Use the **non-SRV** multi-host URI form: `mongodb://user:pass@host-00:27017,host-01:27017,host-02:27017/mockmate?ssl=true&replicaSet=<name>&authSource=admin`. |
| OTP never arrives                           | Configure valid `SMTP_*` values; OTPs are never exposed in logs.                    |
| Quiz mode says it needs a key               | Quiz is fully AI-generated. Add a working `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or a key in the admin panel). |
| Questions look repetitive/generic           | No Gemini key → the offline bank is small. Add a key, or `npm run seed` the bank.   |
| Client 404s on refresh after deploy         | Ensure `vercel.json` (SPA rewrite) is deployed with the client.                     |
| Login works locally, fails after deploy     | Set `VITE_API_URL` to the deployed API, and `CLIENT_URL` (server) to the frontend origin. |
